## My Toolbelt

Unlike a [DevOps Toolchain](./devops-toolchain) that is common and mandatory across a team, a toolbelt is much more personalised - It is good to provide a toolbelt when onboarding, but each individual should be free to modify and tweak the tools that they use.

### Hardware

You cannot go wrong with A MacBook Pro 15" with 16GB (unless you choose the non tactile touchbar version). At one point I had 3 external monitors, but I am only using 2 at the moment as it is all that will fit on my standing desk.  

I am also finding that sometimes using a single screen and toggling between windows using the keyboard is just as good and sometimes better for focus.

### OS

OS X El Capitan (Yeh I know it is old, but I have no reason or time to upgrade and incur the risk and change fatigue)

I disable spotlight as I find it can slow down the machine drastically when indexing, I use [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html).


### Applications

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - I use it to map F1-F6 keys to the 6 most commons apps I use.

    * [Zsh](Zsh) and my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Moshe-Immerman/dotfiles)
