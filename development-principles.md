## Development Principles

These are some of my thoughs on what modern software development should take into account - or at least somewhat good development.

### The laws

These laws apply apply always - they are not suggestions or reccomendations.

* [Conways Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) - organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
* [Brook’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%E2%80%99_law) - Adding more people to a late project, makes it later
* [Ziv’s Law](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/icse97.ps) / Uncertainty Principle- Software development is unpredictable and that the documented artifacts such as specifications and requirements will never be fully understood
* [Humphrey’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Centipede%27s_Dilemma) - People don't know what thy want until they see what they don't want
* [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
* [Kernighan's lever](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/kernighans-lever/) Debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
* [The Cone of Uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Uncertainty) You won’t know how long it will take until it’s complete.
* [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) (Reduce WIP to reduce cycle time)

### Organizational Principles

* Speed vs Safety
* Accountability, Capability & Responsibility
    * Autonomous Teams
    * 2 pizza rule
* Radical Candor


### Management Principles

- Larry Wall: The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.
- Servant leadership
- A manager or leaders job is to make everyone else go faster, safer

### Design Principles

* Make architecture decisions at the last **responsible** moment
* KISS (Keep it simple stupid) 
  * [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law) - plus Parnas and Alexander
  * E. F. Schumacher: Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.
  * Antoine de Saint Exupéry: It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away.
  * Dijkstra's Law: "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better."
